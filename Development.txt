Ideas for further development

1. Another cues tab - "user" which is mutable and saved at exit

2. Thumbnail view of image review table (DONE)

3. Evolve modifiers in two (or three) stages: 
	- thumbnails images representing the style, material or artist
	- keywords associated with each modifier, and then filter by keyword(s)
	-? category specific views (presentation)

 4. In scan mode to have a two or three copies of modifiers panel so the scan can have more than one modifiers.

 5. Get thesaurus and dictionary on board - many possibilities after

 6. API-specific control panel: between cues and modif. OR above modif.
 
 7. Snippets - small pieces of code to control a scan with parameters inside to iterate over
