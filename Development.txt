Ideas for further development

1. Another cues/prompt tab - "user" which is mutable and saved at exit

2. Thumbnail view of image review table

3. Evolve modifiers in two (or three) stages: 
	- thumbnails images representing the style, material or artist
	- keywords associated with each modifier, and then filter by keyword(s)
	-? category specific views (presentation)

 4. In scan mode to have a two or three copies of modifiers panel so the scan can have more than one modifiers.
