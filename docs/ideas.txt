1.	Workflow – based on TreeView wpf 
-	Start new project
-	Auto (optional) add each new query
-	Branch from the last query or from any previous one
-	Browse and compare the parent query with the child  
-	Differential tree – show the parent and the children as difference to the parent
-	Debase a project – create new project using some node as first parent

2.	Find free text/db thesaurus as open source OR try to dive in WordNet.princeton.edu
Any word, cue or modifier can be analized in term of synonym/antonym/merinim/holonim

3.	Think about integrating (image + text) to image generator, so to be ready when one becomes available. Image + text where the text could be PS script, so you can automate certain image processing.

4.	API to local text2image server, try to install one

5.	Think of meta-description (JSON or XML) of extended query.  That contains a series of processing steps and a way to balance steps effect similar to fade in PS – long shot.

6. 	Save log file and later import Log file to create or append cues file (with options)
