Intro

PenPic is the response to the booming development in the text-to-image domain. It's an attempt to apply a more systematic approach in composing the text prompt (cue, here). You will be offered collections of short descriptive texts and collections of modifiers, like a painter, art style, time period, etc.
After composing your cue you can copy and paste it into your favourite text-to-image generator and see to result in your browser. 
Alternatively, you can use API access to some generators (only DeepAI for now) and there is the strong side of PenPic. The cue and the picture become part of your collection with a convenient image viewer. On top of that, you can "scan". After selecting some texts and some modifiers Scan will combine them as every text will be combined with every modifier. So for example if you would like to see how a particular painter would paint different subjects or how specific topic would be painted by different painters. PenPic will generate all the combinations for you (scan) and query the active API for you to put them in an image collection.
