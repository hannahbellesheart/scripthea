The road stretches ahead
A long journey without home
Lonely heart, wanderer.
---
Mountain peaks soar high
A lone figure stands atop
Sorrow in his eyes.
---
Rain falls softly on
A weary soul seeking refuge
From loneliness and pain.
---
Wildflowers bloom in spring
Birds sing their cheerful songs
Lonely heart remains sad.
---
Stars glimmer in the sky
The moon shines brightly tonight
Lonely traveler sleeps.
---
Morning sun rises high
A new day dawns for the wanderer
Hope, he finds in his heart.
---
Rivers flow to the sea
Forgotten dreams wash away
Heart filled with longing.
---
Clouds roll across the sky
A lonely traveler looks up
Hopes for a better life.
---
Leaves rustle in the breeze
Squirrels scamper up the trees
Lonely heart finds peace.
---
Autumn leaves fall to ground
A new season begins anew
Lonely soul finds comfort.
